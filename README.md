# City Clustering and Analysis from Night-Time Satellite Images

This project identifies and visualizes clusters of city lights in night-time satellite images using K-Means clustering. It also calculates distances between detected city centers.

## Features

- Extracts illuminated pixel coordinates from grayscale satellite images.
- Applies K-Means clustering to identify city centers.
- Automatically determines the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.
- Visualizes clusters and centroids on the image.
- Computes pairwise distances between detected city centers.
- Outputs results in tabular and graphical formats.

## How to Use

1. Open the `process_image.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook or any other compatible environment.
2. Ensure the input file (`img.png`) is placed in the same directory or update the file path inside the notebook.
3. Run all cells in the notebook to process the image and view the results.
